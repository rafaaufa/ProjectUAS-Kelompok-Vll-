Touch my body tender
'Cause the feeling makes me weak
Kicking off the covers
I see the ceiling, while you're looking down at me
How can we go back to being friends
When we just shared a bed?
How can you look at me and pretend
I'm someone you've never met?
It was last December
You were layin' on my chest
I still remember
I was scared to take a breath, didn't want you to move your head
How can we go back to being friends
When we just shared a bed? (Yeah)
How can you look at me and pretend
I'm someone you've never met?
The devil in your eyes
Won't deny the lies
You've sold, I'm holding on too tight
While you let go, this is casual
How can we go back to being friends
When we just shared a bed? (Yeah)
How can you look at me and pretend
I'm someone you've never met?
How can we go back to being friends
When we just shared a bed? (Yeah)
How can you look at me and pretend
I'm someone you've never met?
I'm someone you've never met
Oh yeah
